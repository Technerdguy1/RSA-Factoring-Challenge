RSA-Factoring-Challenge
    ---------------------

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public key crytosystem, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission.
The initialism `"RSA"` comes from the surnames of `Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman` who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.

Operation
  -----------------

The RSA algorithm involves four steps:
 - Key generation
 - Key distribution
 - Key encryption and
 - Key decryption
